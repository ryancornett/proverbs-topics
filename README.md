# Proverbs by Topic 
## From Matthew Henryâ€™s *Commentary on the Whole Bible* (1706)

At the end of the section of his commentary on Proverbs, Henry provided a list of 77 categories with corresponding references. He prefaced his list with:
> Twenty chapters of the book of Proverbs (beginning with ch.x.and ending with ch. xxix.), consisting mostly of entire sentences in each verse, could not well be reduced to proper heads, and the contents of them gathered; I have therefore here put the contents of all these chapters together, which perhaps may be of some use to those who desire to see at once all that is said of any one head in these chapters. Some of the verses, perhaps, I have not put under the same heads that another would have put them under, but the most of them fall (I hope) naturally enough to the places I have assigned them.

A modern rendering of the above:
> Twenty chapters of the book of Proverbs, from chapter 10 to chapter 29, mostly consist of complete sentences in each verse. It's challenging to condense these verses into specific themes, as the passages are not thematically focused. This might be helpful for those who want to see all that is said on a particular topic in these chapters at once. While some verses might not be categorized exactly as someone else would, I've tried to place them where they seem to fit best.

*I named the topics, 'Americanized' some words (honour: honor, favour: favor), and combined item descriptions (combinations are separated by ellipses). In the near future I hope to categorize the passages Henry left to his commentary proper (chapters 1-9, 30-31).*
